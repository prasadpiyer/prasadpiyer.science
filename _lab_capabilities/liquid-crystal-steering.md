Liquid-crystal (LC) metasurfaces enable electronically programmable phase profiles for beam steering and programmable optics. We utilize patented technologies—including cross-backplane reflector designs [US 11,429,008], sealed LC packaging [US 11,487,183], and extended-depth dielectric cavities [US 11,914,266]—to implement compact meta‑optic platforms with large phase modulation and scalable electrical addressing.

## Experimental Capabilities

### Capillary Filling System for LC-Metasurface Integration
Our lab features a precision capillary filling setup for the controlled incorporation of liquid crystals into metasurface geometries. The system includes temperature-controlled chambers (25-80°C) for optimizing LC viscosity, vacuum-assisted infiltration for void elimination, and real-time optical monitoring to ensure uniform LC distribution. The setup accommodates nematic, ferroelectric, and blue phase liquid crystals.

### High-Speed Electro-Optic Drive System
We operate a high-frequency electro-optic characterization platform capable of driving liquid crystal metasurfaces at MHz frequencies. The system features arbitrary waveform generators with sub-nanosecond rise times and impedance-matched transmission lines to minimize signal distortion. Multi-channel synchronization enables independent addressing of metasurface zones.

### Polarimetric Holographic Characterization
Our optical measurement suite provides vector field characterization of metasurface responses across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1600 nm). The setup includes tunable laser sources, rotating polarizer/analyzer pairs for full Stokes parameter measurement, and high-resolution CCD/InGaAs detector arrays for spatial field mapping. Lock-in detection and frequency-domain analysis enable measurement of amplitude and phase responses with high dynamic range (>40 dB). The system supports transmission and reflection geometries with automated back-focal plane mapping.
