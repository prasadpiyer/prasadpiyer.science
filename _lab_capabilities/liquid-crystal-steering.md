Liquid-crystal (LC) metasurfaces enable electronically programmable phase profiles for beam steering and programmable optics. Building on our patents — cross-backplane reflector designs [US 11,429,008], sealed LC packaging and device integration [US 11,487,183], and extended-depth dielectric cavities with LC-filled channels [US 11,914,266] — we implement compact meta‑optic platforms that offer large phase modulation, low-loss operation, and scalable electrical addressing.

## Experimental Capabilities

### Capillary Filling System for LC-Metasurface Integration
Our lab features a precision capillary filling setup designed for controlled incorporation of liquid crystals into metasurface geometries. The system includes temperature-controlled chambers (25-80°C) for optimizing LC viscosity during filling, vacuum-assisted infiltration capabilities for complete void elimination, and real-time optical monitoring to ensure uniform LC distribution across metasurface unit cells. The setup accommodates various LC materials including nematic, ferroelectric, and blue phase liquid crystals.

### High-Speed Electro-Optic Drive System
We operate a high-frequency electro-optic characterization platform capable of driving liquid crystal metasurfaces at speeds up to MHz frequencies. The system features arbitrary waveform generators with sub-nanosecond rise times and impedance-matched transmission line architectures to minimize signal distortion. Multi-channel synchronization enables independent addressing of metasurface zones for complex beam steering and holographic pattern generation.

### Polarimetric Holographic Characterization
Our optical measurement suite provides complete vector field characterization of metasurface responses across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1600 nm). The setup includes tunable laser sources, rotating polarizer/analyzer pairs for full Stokes parameter measurement, and high-resolution CCD/InGaAs detector arrays for spatial field mapping. Lock-in detection and frequency-domain analysis enable measurement of both amplitude and phase responses, with sub-degree phase accuracy and dynamic range exceeding 40 dB. The system supports both transmission and reflection geometries with automated bback-focal plane mapping across ±80° field of view.
