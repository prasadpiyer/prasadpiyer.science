Our ultrafast self‑driving lab (SDL) combines femtosecond lasers, programmable optics, and machine‑learning‑driven autonomy to discover and optimize ultrafast light–matter interactions. The platform closes the loop between hypothesis, experiment selection, data acquisition, and interpretable model discovery.

## Experimental Capabilities

### Femtosecond Laser Systems and Optical Parametric Amplification
Our ultrafast infrastructure centers on Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifiers delivering sub-100 fs pulses with mJ-level energies at kHz repetition rates. Optical parametric amplifiers extend wavelength coverage from UV to mid-infrared, enabling resonant excitation across diverse material systems. Computer-controlled delay stages provide sub-femtosecond temporal resolution for pump-probe experiments, while beam-shaping optics ensure precise spatial and temporal control.

### Programmable Ultrafast Beam Steering and Shaping
Spatial light modulators integrated with ultrafast beam paths enable real-time programming of wavefront amplitude and phase profiles. Multi-stage telescopic beam conditioning matches SLM apertures to sample dimensions with variable magnification. High-speed beam steering capabilities support automated sample scanning and angle-resolved measurements across large parameter spaces.

### Time-Resolved Spectroscopy and Momentum-Space Imaging
Our detection suite combines high-resolution spectrometers with sensitive InGaAs cameras for time-resolved photoluminescence and reflectance measurements. Back-focal-plane imaging systems map momentum-space distributions with sub-degree angular resolution. Lock-in detection with dual-frequency chopping enables extraction of ultrafast signals with shot-noise-limited sensitivity across broad spectral ranges (400-2500 nm).

### Machine Learning-Driven Autonomous Operation
The self-driving laboratory framework integrates automated sample handling, measurement protocols, and data analysis through machine learning algorithms. Closed-loop optimization automatically explores parameter spaces to identify optimal conditions for desired optical responses. Real-time data processing and model inference enable rapid hypothesis testing and discovery of emergent phenomena without human intervention.
