### Solid-State LiDAR Technology

LiDAR systems are essential for autonomous vehicles, AR headsets, and 3D mapping. However, traditional mechanical scanners face challenges regarding cost, durability, and size. Our research focuses on **solid-state beam steering** to address these limitations.

At Lumotive, we developed **row/column-addressable liquid crystal metasurfaces** to create phased arrays capable of electrically steering near-infrared laser pulses across >120° with sub-millidegree precision, using low voltage control. This approach enables compact, reliable, and scalable LiDAR systems.

### Technical Innovations

**High-Density Phase Shifters** ― Our cross-bar electrode architecture (US 11,487,183) integrates >10,000 individually controllable phase elements within a 3 mm aperture. This allows for programmable beam patterns without moving parts.

**CMOS-Compatible Operation** ― We achieve >2π phase modulation at <4 V peak-to-peak by integrating thin nematic LC layers with high-index metasurface resonators, making the technology compatible with standard CMOS drive electronics.

**Holographic Beam Forming** ― Our system utilizes dynamic holographic beam forming to create multiple beams simultaneously, enabling flash illumination and adaptive region-of-interest scanning at >10 kHz update rates.

**Wafer-Scale Manufacturing** ― Liquid crystal metasurfaces are fabricated using standard semiconductor lithography, offering a scalable manufacturing path compared to MEMS or mechanical systems.

### Product Development

This technology was translated into a product at Lumotive. The LC-metasurface LiDAR offers a rugged, low-power, and cost-effective solution for beam steering in autonomous systems and AR/VR applications.
