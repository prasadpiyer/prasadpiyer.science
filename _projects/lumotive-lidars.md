### Overview
Lumotive’s beam-steering architecture harnesses **row/column-addressable liquid-crystal (LC) metasurfaces** to direct near-infrared laser pulses without mechanical parts.  On-chip phase shifters provide sub-millidegree resolution across a >120° field-of-view while operating from a single 5 V supply—enabling compact, solid-state LiDAR for autonomous vehicles and augmented-reality (AR) headsets.

### Key contributions
1. **Cross-bar electrode architecture** – our US 11,487,183 patent demonstrated >10 000 individually addressable phase elements on a 3 mm aperture.
2. **Low-voltage LC phase shifters** – thin nematic LC layers integrated atop high-index metasurface resonators achieve >2π phase swing at <4 V pp.
3. **On-chip holographic beam forming** – dynamic holograms enable multi-beam flash illumination and region-of-interest scanning at >10 kHz.

### Impact
The LC-metasurface engine delivers a **cost-effective, wafer-level alternative to MEMS mirrors**, bringing rugged, low-power depth sensing to mobility, robotics and consumer XR.
