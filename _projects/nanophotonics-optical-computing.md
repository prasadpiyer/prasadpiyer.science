### Self-Driving Nanophotonics

We are developing nanophotonic systems that utilize autonomous experimentation to manipulate femtosecond pulses. This involves exploring large parameter spaces to optimize light-matter interactions and uncover physical principles.

Our platform, **AutoSciLab**, integrates machine learning techniques—such as variational autoencoders, active learning, and neural network equation learners—to close the design–fabrication–characterization loop. This allows for the efficient extraction of physical insights from high-dimensional experimental data.

### Key Developments

**Ultrafast Spin Steering** ― We have demonstrated chiral metasurfaces capable of independently rotating left- and right-handed circularly-polarized beams by >30° within *140 femtoseconds*. This enables sub-picosecond manipulation of ultrafast quantum states and spin-encoded information.

**Physics-Aware Optical Computing** ― Our photonic Ising machines utilize free-space diffraction to solve optimization problems. By harnessing Fourier optics, we address 2-million-spin optimization problems at kilohertz rates.

**Chip-Scale Femtosecond Diagnostics** ― We have developed a passive photonic streak camera by encoding quadratic phase profiles into metasurfaces. This device deflects 300-femtosecond pulses by 15° to capture ultrafast dynamics without complex electronics.

**Autonomous Discovery** ― AutoSciLab has been used to rediscover physical laws and uncover new structure–property relationships in nanophotonic emission, demonstrating the capability of AI to aid in physical understanding.

### Impact

Our work aims to enable **photonic processors** capable of real-time sensing, ultrafast communication, and efficient computation. This represents a shift towards programmable photonic systems.
