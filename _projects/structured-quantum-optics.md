### Deterministic Quantum Light Sources

A key challenge in quantum computing is the generation of single photons on demand with high indistinguishability. Our research focuses on **engineering the photonic environment** of semiconductor quantum dots to address this.

We integrate GaAs quantum emitters with metasurfaces, dielectric nanocavities, and carrier-funneling nanostructures to control spontaneous emission, aiming for precise regulation of photon generation.

### Enhanced Quantum Emitters

**Metasurface-Enhanced Extraction** ― We have demonstrated that metasurface integration can significantly enhance collection efficiency while preserving indistinguishability, which is critical for quantum communication.

**Deterministic Brightness** ― By utilizing graded-bandgap carrier funnels, we guide charge carriers to quantum dots, enhancing efficiency and delivering bright emission without degrading quantum properties.

**Multi-Photon Generation** ― We have engineered super-bunched trion cascades (XX⁺→2X⁺ transitions) to enable single quantum dots to emit *three temporally ordered photons* in a controlled sequence, relevant for on-chip cluster states.

**Monolithic Quantum Circuits** ― We are developing waveguide routers and integrated metalenses to direct photons into on-chip photonic circuits with low loss, enabling the coexistence of emitters and photonic logic on the same wafer.

### Scalable Quantum Photonics

Our goal is to **industrialize quantum photonics** by co-designing emitters with their photonic environments. This approach supports the development of wafer-scale quantum chips with deterministic photon sources and addressable qubits.
