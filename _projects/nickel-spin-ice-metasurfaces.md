### Natural Ising Machines

We investigate **natural Ising machines**, where physical systems are used to solve computational problems. Specifically, we explore how magnetic frustration in artificial spin-ice lattices and optical interference patterns can map to the Ising Hamiltonian.

By fabricating nanoscale magnetic islands in specific geometries (e.g., kagome, square ice) and coupling them to free-space optical systems, we aim to utilize inherent parallelism for optimization tasks.

### Engineering Frustrated Magnetism

**Plasmonic Spin-Ice Metasurfaces** ― We utilize nickel nano-island arrays to create tunable magnetic frustration with >5× magneto-optic enhancement. These systems allow for the observation of computational phase transitions and the exploration of energy landscapes.

**Ultrafast Magnetic Imaging** ― Using laser-illuminated photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM), we have captured femtosecond-resolution videos of magnetic vertices flipping in frustrated lattices, providing insight into dynamics at terahertz rates.

**Optical Solver for Optimization** ― We have developed a free-space machine that encodes spin couplings into spatial light patterns and reads out ground states through Fourier optics. This system addresses fully-connected Ising problems, such as Max-Cut, at room temperature using spatial light modulators.

**Deep Learning and Magnetism** ― We employ generative models to analyze spin configurations and discover physical relationships governing magnetic frustration from microscopy images.

### Significance

This research demonstrates the potential of **natural analogue computers** to perform optimization tasks efficiently. By harnessing physical interactions, we aim to develop energy-efficient and scalable computing architectures.
