### Thermally Reconfigurable Antennas

We are developing **optical devices capable of real-time reconfiguration** using **epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) substrates**. By depositing nanophotonic antennas onto ENZ films (e.g., doped indium oxide, cadmium oxide), we leverage field confinement near the zero-index transition to achieve resonance shifts and radiation pattern control.

### Tunability via ENZ Materials

**ENZ Amplification of Thermo-Optic Effects** ― By coupling dielectric resonators to ENZ substrates, we have demonstrated 5 nm/V tuning, a significant enhancement over conventional silicon antennas, while maintaining high Q-factors (>150). This is achieved without phase-change materials, relying instead on the field concentration properties of ENZ materials.

**Thermally Reconfigurable Meta-Lenses** ― We have developed binary-phase CdO pillar arrays that allow for dynamic reconfiguration of focal length (from 50 to 120 μm) using 10 milliwatts of Joule heating.

**High Efficiency** ― The field enhancement near ENZ transitions enables optical reconfiguration with high efficiency, suitable for low-power applications.

### Future Outlook

Our work contributes to the development of **active optical elements** that can sense and adapt. Potential applications include adaptive infrared cameras, programmable thermal emitters, and dynamic wavefront shapers for free-space communication.
