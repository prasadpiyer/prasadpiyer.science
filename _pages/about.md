## Autonomy of Scientific Discovery

What if scientific experiments could design, execute, and interpret themselves—discovering physical principles faster than any human could imagine? At the **Autonomous Nanophotonics Lab**, we're making this vision a reality.

We're pioneering a radical new paradigm where **artificial intelligence becomes the experimentalist**, autonomously navigating vast parameter spaces to uncover hidden physics, optimize exotic materials, and design photonic systems that harness light in ways never before possible.

### Our Approach: Where AI Meets Light

Machine learning doesn't just assist our research—it **drives discovery**. Our self-driving laboratories integrate:

* **Autonomous experimentation** at femtosecond timescales, where AI orchestrates ultrafast spectroscopy, structured light patterns, and nanofabrication to reveal emergent light–matter interactions invisible to traditional methods
* **Interpretable discovery engines** that don't just optimize—they extract human-readable physical laws from high-dimensional experimental data, turning black-box results into actionable scientific insight  
* **Reconfigurable photonic hardware** spanning quantum emitters, liquid-crystal metasurfaces, and photonic Ising machines that compute at the speed of light with energy efficiencies orders of magnitude beyond electronics

### From Quantum Dots to Next-Gen Computing

Our discoveries are enabling transformative technologies:

* **Quantum information systems** with deterministic single-photon sources precisely controlled at the nanoscale
* **Ultrafast optical computing** performing complex optimization and AI inference entirely with photons
* **Intelligent LiDAR and imaging** using electrically reconfigurable metasurfaces for autonomous vehicles and AR/VR
* **Self-driving scientific instruments** openly available to the global research community through the *Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT)*

### Come work with us !

We are part of the [Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT)](https://cint.lanl.gov), a DOE Nanoscale Science Research Center. Interested in using our facilities? [Submit a new user proposal here](https://cint.sandia.gov).

Whether you're a **prospective student** seeking to shape the future of science, a **CINT user** looking to supercharge your research with autonomous tools, or an **industry partner** ready to translate breakthrough physics into transformative products—we invite you to collaborate with us.

**The age of human-limited discovery is transforming into the autonomous era.**
