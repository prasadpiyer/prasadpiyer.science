I am a **Senior Member of Technical Staff** at the *Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT)*, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque&nbsp;(NM). My research blends autonomous scientific discovery with reconfigurable nanophotonics, quantum optics and semiconductor quantum-dot systems. By combining nanofabrication, ultrafast spectroscopy and machine-learning–driven control, my group develops next-generation platforms for optical computing and on-chip light manipulation.

Previously, I was a **Senior LiDAR Systems Engineer** at *Lumotive Inc.* and served as **Technical Advisor** to the start-ups *Neurophos* and *Lumotive* on the productisation of metasurface technologies. I earned my **Ph.D.** and **M.S.** in Electrical & Computer Engineering (Electronics & Photonics) from the *University of California, Santa Barbara*, and a **B.Tech.** in Materials & Metallurgical Engineering from the *Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur*.

My full curriculum vitae is available as an [interactive HTML page](/cv/) or you can [download the PDF](/files/Prasad_P_Iyer__March_2025.pdf).
