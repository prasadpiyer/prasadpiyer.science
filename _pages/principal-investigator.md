I am a **Senior Member of Technical Staff** at the *Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT)*, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque (NM). My research focuses on autonomous scientific discovery, reconfigurable nanophotonics, quantum optics, and semiconductor quantum-dot systems. My group combines nanofabrication, ultrafast spectroscopy, and machine learning to develop platforms for optical computing and on-chip light manipulation.

Previously, I served as a **Senior LiDAR Systems Engineer** at *Lumotive Inc.* and as a **Technical Advisor** to *Neurophos* and *Lumotive* on metasurface technologies. I received my **Ph.D.** and **M.S.** in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the *University of California, Santa Barbara*, and a **B.Tech.** in Materials & Metallurgical Engineering from the *Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur*.

My full curriculum vitae is available as an [interactive HTML page](/cv/) or you can [download the PDF](/files/Prasad_P_Iyer__March_2025.pdf).
