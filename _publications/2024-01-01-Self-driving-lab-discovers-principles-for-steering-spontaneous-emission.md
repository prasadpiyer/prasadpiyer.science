abstract: 'We developed an autonomous experimentation platform to accelerate interpretable
  scientific discovery in ultrafast nanophotonics, targeting a novel method to steer
  spontaneous emission from reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces. Controlling
  spontaneous emission is crucial for clean-energy solutions in illumination, thermal
  radiation engineering, and remote sensing. Despite the potential of reconfigurable
  semiconductor metasurfaces with embedded sources for spatiotemporal control, achieving
  arbitrary far-field control remains challenging. Here, we present a self-driving
  lab (SDL) platform that addresses this challenge by discovering the governing equations
  for predicting the far-field emission profile from light-emitting metasurfaces.
  We discover that both the spatial gradient (grating-like) and the curvature (lens-like)
  of the local refractive index are key factors in steering spontaneous emission.
  The SDL employs a machine-learning framework comprising: (1) a variational autoencoder
  for generating complex spatial refractive index profiles, (2) an active learning
  agent for guiding experiments with real-time closed-loop feedback, and (3) a neural
  network-based equation learner to uncover structure-property relationships. The
  SDL demonstrated a four-fold enhancement in peak emission directivity (up to 77%)
  over a 72° field of view within ~300 experiments. Our findings reveal that
  combinations of positive gratings and lenses are as effective as negative lenses
  and gratings for all emission angles, offering a novel strategy for controlling
  spontaneous emission beyond conventional Fourier optics.'
